# lambda-js

LambdaJS is a TypeScript utility library intended to be used as a lightweight replacement for jQuery.

## Note

This library is not actively maintained and last modified in 2017. It will probably not work with current versions of TypeScript and npm.

## Installation

`lambda-js` can be installed with npm.

```bash
npm install https://github.com/jonaszell97/lambda-js.git
```

## Usage

LambdaJS makes its functionality available in a global `$` variable, similar to jQuery. You can reference this variable from anywhere in your code.
